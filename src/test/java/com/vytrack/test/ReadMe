I have added new Driver utility class which we are gonna use instead of
@BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod. Just call this method by its class name Driver.getDriver() and it is gonna
create new driver and open up window for us. If you already have an existing driver then it is gonna return the same
driver that you are working on.Also I have added closeDriver() method into this Driver class because we
are gonna use it when we want to close our driver(window). Just call it by class name Drive.closeDriver() .
Good luck!
